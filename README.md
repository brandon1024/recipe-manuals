# recipe-manuals
Open recipes for nerdy chefs. Follow from the terminal or browser.

## Why?
The internet is pretty disappointing these days. The services we use every day
are often bloated with ads and trackers that render these websites virtually
unusable. Recipe websites and blogs are particularly bad. These sites are
usually cluttered with nonsense video ads, annoying popups and a lengthy
irrelevant preamble.

## What?
This project is a collection of delicious recipes that can be followed from
a browser or from a terminal. Each recipe is consistently structured, with
both metric and imperial measurements, and will never begin with annoying life
story.

No ads, no trackers, no BS.
