# INSTRUCTIONS

  - In a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, add **cake flour** (750mL, 3
    cups), **salt** (1.25mL, 1/4 teaspoon), **sugar** (250mL, 1 cup),
    **baking** powder (20mL, 4 teaspoons), **eggs** (2) and **vanilla
    extract** (10mL, 2 teaspoons). Mix in the **milk** (375mL, 1 1/2
    cups).

  - While the mixer is still running, slowly add the **melted butter**
    (125mL, 1/2 cup). Mix just until combined.

  - Spray a 9Ã—13 pan with cooking spray and spread the batter out evenly
    in the pan.

  - To make the cinnamon filling, use a small bowl and a wooden spoon to
    combine **softened butter** (250mL, 1 cups), **brown sugar** (250mL,
    1 cup), **cake flour** (30mL, 2 tablespoons) and **cinnamon** (15mL,
    1 tablespoon).

  - Drop the cinnamon filling by spoonfuls onto the cake batter. Take a
    butter knife and drag it through both the cinnamon and cake batter
    layers, making a pretty marble effect.

  - Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes, or until a knife inserted
    into the center comes out clean.

  - In a small mixing bowl, whisk together **powdered sugar** (500mL, 2
    cups), **milk** (75mL, 5 tablespoons) and **vanilla extract** (5mL,
    1 teaspoon). Pour the glaze over the warm cinnamon cake.
